❌ Never manually edit the database
✅ Always change schema.prisma
✅ Always generate migrations

# CMD
❌ migrate dev → LOCAL ONLY
✅ migrate deploy → PRODUCTION ONLY / remote database

------------
schema.prisma → blueprint

migrations/ → history

CI → checks everything is valid

CD → applies migrations + runs app

Docker → guarantees same environment

# summary
    - CI/CD automates checking and deploying your app, 
        and Prisma migrations make sure the database safely 
        follows your code in every environment.
