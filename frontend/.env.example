# Frontend Environment Variables

# API URL (optional)
# If not set, the app will use window.location.origin (recommended for production)
# This allows the frontend to automatically connect through nginx reverse proxy
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Development note:
# When running in Docker, the frontend connects to the backend through nginx
# The browser makes requests to http://localhost:8080, which nginx proxies to:
# - /chat/* -> chat_service:3001
# - /socket.io/* -> chat_service:3001 (WebSocket)
